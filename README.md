## 🎯 Objective  
To understand the characteristics of a strong password, create multiple password samples of varying complexity, evaluate them using online password strength checkers, and analyze the results.  
The aim is to identify best practices for creating secure passwords and understand how password complexity affects protection against common attacks.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- [🔗 PasswordMonster](https://passwordmonster.com) – Password strength evaluation tool  

---

## 📖 Methodology  

1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels.  
1. Tested each password on **PasswordMonster.com**.  
1. Recorded the **score and feedback**.  
1. Compared results to identify factors contributing to password strength.  
1. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, hybrid).  
1. Summarized key findings into **best practices** for password creation.

## 📊 Results  

### 🔎 Password Strength Evaluation  
--------------------------------------------------
| 🔑 Password        | 📈 Cracking Time| 💬 Feedback |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `ringarose`         | 12.48 Seconds |  Very Weak  |
| `ea#$fe	`         |  2 days    	|  Medium  |
| `dea#$Mafi()496snu0=-`         |  95 M T years  |  Very Strong  |

## 💡 Key Observations & Tips Learned  

✅ Length is critical → passwords above **12 characters** are significantly stronger.  
✅ Use a **mix** of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
✅ Avoid **dictionary words** and predictable sequences.  
✅ **Randomness increases strength** → unpredictable combinations are harder to crack.  
✅ **Passphrases are ideal** → easy to remember, hard to break.

## ⚔️ Password Attacks & Impact of Complexity  

<details>
<summary>🔓 Brute Force Attack</summary>
Tries every possible combination. Weak passwords (like `ringarose123`) can be cracked within seconds.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📖 Dictionary Attack</summary>
Uses precompiled lists of common words. Any single dictionary word (like `Password`) is vulnerable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🧪 Hybrid Attack</summary>
Combines dictionary + variations (e.g., `Password@123`). Easily defeats slightly modified common words.
</details>

### 📌 Impact of Complexity  
- Short/simple passwords = **highly vulnerable** ⚠️  
- Longer + complex passwords = **exponentially harder** to crack 🔐  
- Example:  
  - `ringarose123` → cracked in seconds ⏱  
  - `dea@$785fgCG5SN78%^J)8FRB` → estimated cracking time in **billions of years** 🌌  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion  

A strong password should be:  

1. At least **12–16 characters** long.  
1. Include a **mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
1. Avoid dictionary words or predictable sequences.  
1. Prefer **passphrases** (easy to remember, hard to crack).  

By following these practices, password security is significantly improved, reducing the risk of compromise through brute force or dictionary-based attacks.
